- 👋 Hi, I’m @mirandaclayton
- 👀 I’m interested in making things! I'm an artist and am working on transitioning from a career as a high school art teacher to a career in graphic design, UX/UI, or web design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning foundations of coding across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Python, as well as data analytics and UX/UI Design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that could use an artist or educator's perspective. I'm hoping to build my portfolio and continue to learn through action.
- 👀 Here is my <a href="https://mirandaclayton.myportfolio.com>graphic design portfolio</a> and my <a href="https:/mirandaleecreative.wixsite.com/uxportfolio">My UX Portfolio</a> 
- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="https://linkedin.com/mirandalclayton/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:mirandaclayton92@gmail.com">email</a>
